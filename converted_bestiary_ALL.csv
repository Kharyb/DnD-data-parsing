Geist Powers: Geists are as varied as the humans they were in life. In addition to the traits and actions all geists possess, an individual geist might have any of the following special characteristics. 
Geist Powers: Intangible Virtue: A living creature possessed by a white-aligned geist gains immunity to the charmed and frightened conditions, and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. While the creature is possessed, the geist can allow it to take control of its body, but the geist can regain control at any time (no action required).
Geist Powers: Horrifying Visage: Black-aligned geists can make themselves terrible to behold, even when they are possessing the living. Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the geist that can see it must succeed on a {@dc 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 Ã— 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this geist's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a greater restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.","
Withering Touch: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage.
Etherealness: The geist enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.
Possession  - Recharge : One creature that the geist can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC: 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the geist; the geist then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The geist now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness.

It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the geist ends it as a bonus action, or the geist is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the geist reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this geist's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends. The geist can instead target the corpse of a creature, effectively using its own life force to animate the corpse as a zombie.

Berserk: Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see.

Dwarven Resilience: Augrek has advantage on saving throws against poison.
Shapechanger: If Zorak isn't in sunlight or running water, he can use his action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into his true form.
Legendary Resistance (3/Day): If Zorak fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.
Misty Escape: When he drops to 0 hit points outside his resting place, Zorak transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that he isn't in sunlight or running water. If he can't transform, he is destroyed.
Regeneration: Zorak regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn if he has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If Zorak takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of Zorak's next turn.
Spider Climb: Zorak can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
Vampire Weaknesses: Zorak has the following flaws:","
Multiattack: Zorak makes two attacks with his dwarven thrower, only one of which can be a ranged attack.
Dwarven Thrower: Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: ++12 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage, or 12 (1d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack. On a ranged attack that hits, the hammer deals an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage (2d8 if the target is a giant). {@i Hit or Miss: If thrown, the weapon flies back to Zorak's hand after the attack.
Multiattack (Vampire Form Only): Zorak makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.
Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only): Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, Zorak can grapple the target (escape DC: 18).
Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only): Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by Zorak, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Zorak regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces his hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under Zorak's control.
Charm: Zorak targets one humanoid he can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see Zorak, the target must succeed on a DC: 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by Zorak. The charmed target regards Zorak as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under Zorak's control, it takes Zorak's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for Zorak's bite attack.
Children of the Night (1/Day): Zorak magically calls 2d4 swarms of swarm of bats||bats or swarm of rats||rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, Zorak can call 3d6 wolf||wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of Zorak and obeying his spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until Zorak dies, or until Zorak dismisses them as a bonus action.","
